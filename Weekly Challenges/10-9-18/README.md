- **Try to solve these problems on your own before looking at our solution.**
- Learned about maps and iterators. Learn maps [here](https://thispointer.com/stdmap-tutorial-part-1-usage-detail-with-examples/) want to learn about iterators click [here](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/stl/iterators.html)
- Solved [Registration Systems](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/C) and [All Vowels](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/hash-tables/basics-of-hash-tables/practice-problems/algorithm/all-vowels-2/)
  1. [Registration Systems](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/C) we solved together as a simple example on maps. [Solution](https://github.com/espinozahector/RCC-ACM/blob/master/CodeForces/Registration_System/main.cpp)
  2. [All Vowels](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/hash-tables/basics-of-hash-tables/practice-problems/algorithm/all-vowels-2/) [Solution](https://github.com)
