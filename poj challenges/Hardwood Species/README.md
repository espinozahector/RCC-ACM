# RCC-ACM
- This problem was solved in two ways. One using two parallel arrays. The other with a map.

- [No map solution](https://github.com/espinozahector/RCC-ACM/blob/master/poj%20challenges/Hardwood%20Species/no_map.cpp) A simple approach to store the data was to create 2 parallel arrays. One for the tree name and the occurances of each tree. 
- [map solution](https://github.com/espinozahector/RCC-ACM/blob/master/poj%20challenges/Hardwood%20Species/with_map.cpp) A much more efficient soltion was to take advantage of the unique key and value that maps have. This makes our code much more concise and easy to use.
