# RCC-ACM
- This problem was solved in two ways. One with string manipulation and stoi and atoi. The other with math and modulus operator.
- [Math Solution](https://github.com/espinozahector/RCC-ACM/blob/master/poj%20challenges/Adding%20Reversed%20Numbers/math_solution.cpp) I highly recommend this method, seeing as it uses less computing power and avoids the need to convert string <-> int.
- [String Solution](https://github.com/espinozahector/RCC-ACM/blob/master/poj%20challenges/Adding%20Reversed%20Numbers/string_solution.cpp) is a much more beginner friendly solution as long as you know how to manipulate strings and use atoi/stoi.
